# Summary 
This project was all about creating a full responsive website. This was the third main website from Skillcrush that I had to replicate as assigned. 
I had to combine everything I learn from flexbox, inserting images, social media icons, and maps, and media queries.  Although this website is not
in detail, but surfing through the website gives the audience an idea that the website is about camping and experience nature.

### Description/ walk-through
At first glance the image of a woman will capture your eye. As youo scroll down the home page you will see where you can type in your name 
to sign into the website. Once you get to the feature section, there will be logos ontop of small description. The cool part is when you minamize the screen
it will be one column. As you widden the screen the columns become two and once it gets to full-width there will be three columns and two rows.I had to use 
flexbox but the outcome made the homepage that much more professional looking. 

The about page you had text with fictional writing but the best part was inserting a map into the website.
Since it isn't a real business, I had to use a random location to complete this page.

The faq page is in gibberish like the rest of the website, but the focus was being able to use flexbox layout. Overall, this Skillcrush project was a challenge
but the final outcome only prepared me for more advance web responsive websites.

***** The cool effect is the green hover on the navigattion bar *****

#### Software used:
Adobe Dreamweaver (text-editor)

#### What I learn:
Since I had past experience on the basics of HTML and CSS, that was more of a breeze. But, the challenge was fusing flexbox and media queries in order 
to create three different layouts to be cohesive tothe device used 

##### Challenges to improve on
1. Flexbox is a challenge which I need to work on more.
2. Margins and Paddings


##### Solutions/solving the issue:
The first time I did this project it took me an entire month to understand new concepts to create a more advance layout. Even then, there were so many errors with 
how I coded this site that I had to start over again and see what went wrong. Honestly, I am glad that this happen so that I know what not to do for
future projects. But, once I completed this project, which took me less than three weeks to complete, on second try. I was so proud of myself.

1. Try to keep widths 100%

2. Use margins and paddings with ems and rems NOT pxs.

3. Be mindful with how you use the </div> because it can make a difference
